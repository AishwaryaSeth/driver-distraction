Contains Python code for Studying Influence of Internal Factors on Driver Distraction. 


Classification and in-depth analysis of these various forms of distraction can allow for intelligent alert systems. Before creating an artificial intelligence system, it is imperative to understand the various parameters that are interplaying in the current environment. Based on how these factors influence the behavior of a driver, the corrective measures should be suggested to the driver. (At later stages, such changes may be incorporated into the vehicle itself.)
